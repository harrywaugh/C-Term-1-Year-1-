Sketch.c Extension

For my extension I added a new extended opcode, opcode 7. This takes an amount of extra bytes.
My new operation takes in an amount of sides, and then draws a polygon to the canvas. I have included
several examples of sketch files that use this operation. These include:
-diamond.sketch
-triangle.sketch
-hexagon.sketch
-circle.sketch
The last one isnt a "true" circle, it just has 256 sides and looks like one..
